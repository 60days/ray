To start using Ray any PHP project , install the `ray` package.

```bash
php artisan spatie/ray
```

You should be able to use the `ray` function without any other steps.

If you use Laravel, you should use install [the Laravel specific package](/docs/ray/v1/getting-started/installation-in-laravel) instead of `spatie/ray`.
